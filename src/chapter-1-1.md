Definition and Overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
=====================================================================

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that seeks to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human-level intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing.

AI is based on the idea that machines can be designed to perform tasks in a way that mimics human intelligence. This can be achieved through a variety of approaches, including rule-based systems, machine learning, and deep learning.

Rule-based systems involve programming computers with a set of predefined rules that they use to make decisions or perform tasks. Machine learning, on the other hand, involves training algorithms on large datasets to identify patterns and structures in the data and make predictions based on this information. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with multiple layers of interconnected nodes.

In recent years, advances in AI have led to a range of new applications and innovations across a variety of fields, including music and art. AI-based tools and techniques are enabling creators to develop new forms of creative expression that blur the boundaries between human and machine creativity.

However, the use of AI in artistic contexts also raises important ethical and societal considerations, including concerns around data bias, the role of human creativity and agency in artistic expression, and the impact of AI on our cultural values and beliefs.

In this book, we explore the ways in which AI is transforming creative industries, and examine the key AI techniques used in music and art, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Ultimately, we seek to offer a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the intersection of technology and the arts, and provide insights and inspiration for those seeking to navigate this rapidly-evolving landscape.
